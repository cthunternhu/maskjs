## Description

𝙁𝙖𝙘𝙚 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙠 𝘿𝙚𝙩𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙤𝙧: 𝙄 𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙖 𝙨𝙞𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚 𝙁𝙖𝙘𝙚 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙠 𝘿𝙚𝙩𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙤𝙧 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙏𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙧𝙛𝙡𝙤𝙬 (𝙢𝙡𝟓.𝙟𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙥𝟓𝙟𝙨).

Correct: mask on (107 sample images)
Wrong: no mask (100 sample images)
Wrong: nose visible (127 sample images)

I can imagine that a face mask detector, could really benefit public places like schools, airports, and cafes.
